  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">a. Our own records;</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">b. Records at Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. CRAs supply to us both public information (including information from the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">c. Records at Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPA's)</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will make use of the information received as a result of these checks in order to assess your application for credit, verify your identity and to prevent and detect crime and money laundering.
